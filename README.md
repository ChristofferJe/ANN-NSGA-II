# ANN-NSGA-II
Implementation of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) NSGA-II algorithm. 

The classes in this repository is defined to implement the ANN-NSGA-II and NSGA-II algorithms as descriped in my report.
The `test.py` shows how to use both the ANN-NSGA-II and NSGA-II algorithm on the instance of the assignment problem with size 200.
